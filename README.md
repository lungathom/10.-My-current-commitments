# 10.-My-current-commitments
commitment
Time is not an issue for me, i'm still single, young and have alot of energy to invest in my career and future me. Finance wise is not an easy duty, at times you get it right and at times you get it wrong, and the importance is to admit my mistakes and try to rectify as i'm doing right now to get my financials in order
